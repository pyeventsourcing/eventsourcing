Guides
======

This library using `GNU make`_ utility and multiple python packages for code linting. You can read more
about it at `this article`_. The actual code of the provided commands below can be easily found and read in
`Makefile` at the root of this project. But first, you need to setup your local development environment.

.. _GNU make: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/
.. _this article: https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile


How to configure the development environment
--------------------------------------------

This project runs on Python 3.6+, and you need to have it installed on your system.
The recommended way for all platforms is to use `official download page`_.
But also, you may use pyenv_.

.. _official download page: https://www.python.org/downloads/
.. _pyenv: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv

Consider to use virtualenv for development, choose for your flavor:

- virtualenvwrapper_
- pyenv-virtualenv_ for pyenv_

.. _virtualenvwrapper: https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
.. _pyenv-virtualenv: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv

Use following command inside your activated virtualenv to install all project dependencies
required for contribution::

    make install

Setup `git` to ignore specific revs with `blame`.

This project is old, and several times in its history a massive changes were performed.
One such change is moving towards `isort/flake8` utility, another] bulk update is
`black` formatter. While these changes are inevitable, they clutter the history,
especially if you use `git blame` or _Annotate_ option in PyCharm.
But in newer versions of git (>= 2.23), this can be mitigated: new options `--ignore-rev`_
and `--ignore-revs-file`_ were added.  There is a file in this repository called
`.git-blame-ignore-revs` which contains all such major reformattings. In order to pick it up by
`git blame` and PyCharm, add a special config line::

    git config --local blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs

More info can be found here_.

.. _--ignore-revs-file: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame#Documentation/git-blame.txt---ignore-revs-fileltfilegt

How to manage Docker containers
-------------------------------

You need to manage Docker containers with third-party services to have better experience with local development.
To build docker images::

    make docker-build

To up and keep running containers in detached mode::

    make docker-up

To stop the containers::

    make docker-stop

To tear down the containers removing orphans::

    make docker-down

To attach to the latest containers output::

    make docker-logs

All of the commands using predefined ``COMPOSE_FILE`` and ``COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`` in order to keep
your containers in more organized and simple way.

**COMPOSE_FILE** is used by *docker-compose* utility to pick development services
configuration. The valid format of this value is: ``dev/docker-compose.yaml``.

**COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME** sets the project name. This value used to prepend the
containers on startup along with the service name. ``eventsourcing`` is a great default value for it.


How to lint your code
---------------------

Run isort_ to check imports sorting::

    make lint-isort

We are using Black_ as a tool for style guide enforcement::

    make lint-black

We are using Flake8_ to check the code for PEP8_ compatibility::

    make lint-flake8

Mypy_ is a static type checker for Python 3 and Python 2.7. Run mypy to check code for accurate typing annotations::

    make lint-mypy

Dockerfilelint_ is an `npm` module that analyzes a Dockerfile and looks for
common traps, mistakes and helps enforce best practices::

    make lint-dockerfile

... and finally, to run all the checks from above, use::

    make lint

.. _isort: https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort
.. _Black: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
.. _Dockerfilelint: https://hub.docker.com/r/replicated/dockerfilelint
.. _Flake8: https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/
.. _PEP8: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
.. _Mypy: https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/


How to apply automatic formatting
---------------------------------

To apply automatic formatting by using isort_ and Black_, run::

    make fmt


How to test this library
------------------------

Just run this::

    make test

... or push the code to trigger TravisCI checks.


How to build documentation
--------------------------

This project using Sphinx_ documentation builder tool. Run this command to compile documentation
into static HTML files at `./docs/_build/html`::

    make docs

.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

# To use this Docker file in PyCharm, just add a new Docker project interpreter,
# and set an image name such as "eventsourcing_requirements:latest". It will
# take a little while to download and build everything, but then tests which
# do not depend on other services such as MySQL and Cassandra should pass.
# To run containers needed to pass the full test suite, see docker-compose.yaml.
